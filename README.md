# networkScanner
This is a basic network scanner. Put in your ip address and let it scan the networks you are connected to 
I have added a packet sniffer to detect traffic coming from a network or a website.
To access it run "Python3 networkScanner.py -<tag name> or --<arguments> <your target ip address>"
