# networkScanner
This is a basic network scanner. Put in your ip address and let it scan the networks you are connected to. 
I have added a packet sniffer to detect traffic coming from a network or a website.
To access it run ***Python3 networkScanner.py -[argument tag] or --[arguments] [your target ip address/interface]***

To run the interface, simply run ***Python3 networkScanner.py -i [your interface] or Python networkScanner.py --interface [your interface]***
